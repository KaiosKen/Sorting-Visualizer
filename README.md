# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
The **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web-based application that allows users to visualize and learn different sorting algorithms. With support for multiple programming languages, users can implement and run sorting algorithms in JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, Swift, Rust, and more. Whether you're a student learning algorithms or a seasoned programmer, this tool helps you understand sorting algorithms visually.

## Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize a variety of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and more.
- **Multi-language Support**: Write and run sorting algorithms in JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, Swift, and Rust.
- **Dynamic Code Editor**: Users can write their own algorithms using a built-in code editor (powered by CodeMirror).
- **Theme Selection**: Choose from various editor themes, including popular dark and light modes.
- **Live Visualization**: Watch how different algorithms sort data step-by-step in real-time.
- **Boilerplate Code for Different Languages**: Pre-defined templates for C++, Java, Python, and more to simplify code writing.
- **Open Source**: Completely open source and hosted on GitHub, contributions are welcome!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for backend execution)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for supporting multiple languages like C++, Java, Python, etc.)
- Live Server extension for VS Code (if using local testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

4. **Open the frontend in a live server** (such as Live Server in VS Code):
    - Right-click `index.html` and click **"Open with Live Server"**.

5. **Using Docker for running multi-language support**:
    - Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
    - Run the Docker container (additional setup instructions coming soon).

### Usage

- Open the app in your browser.
- Write sorting algorithms in the editor or use pre-existing ones.
- Select the desired language from the dropdown.
- Press "Run" to see the algorithm in action.

## Available Algorithms
Currently, the following algorithms are supported:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

## Screenshots
*To be added.*

## Planned Features
- Save and share custom sorting algorithms.
- Real-time collaboration for coding algorithms with others.
- Custom array generation for testing algorithms.
